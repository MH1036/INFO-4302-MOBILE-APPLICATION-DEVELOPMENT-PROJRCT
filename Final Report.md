### 1.1 INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this report is to provide the plan and activities of the proposed application project based on the plan and activities in developing. The project is about a mobile application that can help IIUM security’s officers to identify the students and the staff by using the camera in the mobile and match it with their data in the database. The application can help also in preventing outsiders and fake students.  
 	 
### 1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
**1.2.1 Background of the problem** 
Most of hardship of the security guards when they need to check every person entering the university by checking their matric card and for the outsiders they need to resent an id to enter the university. Most of the time when it is crowded, the guards will not check all the intruders since they are a lot and no time to go through all the matric cards.  This app can prevent fake or expired matric from entering the university.
 
**1.2.2 Problem Statement**   
As far as we concern there is no mobile application that provides the user with such features as the system proposed. So, this might be the first system can give the officer a help in identifying who is real student and who is not a student in lesser time and more efficient than manually checking. Plus, it can help those who forgot or lost their matric cards to enter the university without having any problem. 	 
 
### 1.3 PROJECT OBJECTIVE 
•	This project is aimed to proffer a system that can be easy to use and efficient in finding information about student, staff or outsider.
•	To develop a mobile application can identify student and match their face or matric number in the system’s database.
•	Help IIUM security by providing an app can be used to recognize outsider and register them to IIUM visitor’s system 
•	Help students to prove if there are registered in the university in case of losing or forgetting their matric cards.
 
 
### 1.4 PROJECT SCOPE 
 
**1.4.1 Scope**
The application that will be developed for IIUM community where the scope will be
local and for a testing purpose the data will contain 5 records as a student to test
and one user (security Gard)
**1.4.2 Targeted User**
The targeted users divided to two main category users will use the app as admin, which will be IIUM security officers and security guards. While, users who will be scanned to find their information in the application’s database. The scanned users are: Student, staff and outsider where those who filed to be identified as student or staff, will be registered as visitors.
 
**1.4.3 Specific Platform** 
To build this project we are trying to apply all the knowledge we gain in our class by using react native framework for writing the mobile application codes for iOS and android also using the APIs platform to access the phone camera and other features. The software is needed to develop the app are android studio to use the in-building function and simulate the app on android studio emulator, visual studio code to write our code and tested, Node.js, JDK 1.8 and react native documentation to build a cross-platform app and re-use the codes that will help us. 
The application will be tested and used on a real mobile phone as hardware is required. This is a demo version where we will create our own database but, in the future, there is a specific requirement where the application need to access IIUM database   
### 1.5 CONSTRAINTS 
-	Security. Once the app is finished, it will not be secured against all attacks either in the database server or the actual layout of the app, through the network lines. 
-	Performance of the app. We will most likely brute force most of our algorithm, most of them will have a big O of O (n²). Which will cause a slow process if the data is large and consume rather more time than an effective algorithm. 
-	Real time database, android need to be connected to the internet all the time to interact with the database (retrieve and insert) since the project is built in Expo and not 100% native.
-	Expo, unlike native applications, expo will only work when it is connected to the internet and will be harder to convert the app to apk file.  
 
### 1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT 
This project plays a huge role in the development of the security system inside the university. And could be applied to other spectrum of industries like companies, call centers, fellowships and many more, depending on the need of it. Since new technology will be used which is face recognition. And it will save time to check who will enter the area. Plus it will avoid the loophole of passing student cards to guest students in order to enter the campus of the university as regular student. Each face is unique, and each face has its own face print. However, this does not mean that guest people are not allowed to enter the university. If a guest is spotted by not finding him in the database. Everything will be handled by the machine though our algorithms. Which is the road we are heading to as an industry of computer science and information technology. 
 
### 2.1 Development Stage
In this project the developers used a react native language to create the app. The database used in the development is Firebase provided by Google.
The app’s front page will show the logo and two buttons, the first one is to check the student by using the camera recognition and check the database to show the student’s information. The other button is to register the visitors in the system (Database), to be identified by the other security officers.
In case the face recognition did not work, the officer has another method to check by inserting the matric number in provided text field to confirm whether the student is exists in the database or not. 

**2.1.1 Functions**
-	Camera recognition
-	Database connector 
-	Form, to register new visitor to the system
-	Retrieve the data from database
-	Router, to connect the pages.
